  "justification": "The dialogue is generally strong, with moments of tension and emotional depth, particularly in the diplomat's vulnerability. However, some lines feel a bit clichéd, and the pacing of tension could be improved. The characters are mostly consistent, but there are moments where their reactions could be more nuanced to enhance the overall impact.",
