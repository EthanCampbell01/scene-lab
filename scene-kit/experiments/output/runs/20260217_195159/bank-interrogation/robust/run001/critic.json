  "justification": "The dialogue is generally strong, with moments of tension that effectively convey the high stakes of the interrogation. However, some lines feel a bit formulaic, detracting from the overall impact. The emotional coherence is solid, as the character's responses align with their predicament, but there are instances where the tension could be more pronounced to enhance the narrative experience.",
