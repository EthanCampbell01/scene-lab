  "justification": "The scene effectively builds tension and maintains emotional coherence, particularly through the diplomat's fear and the stakes involved. However, some dialogue feels generic, and there are moments of awkward phrasing that detract from the overall impact. The choices presented are engaging, but the character depth could be enhanced for a more memorable experience.",
