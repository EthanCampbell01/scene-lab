  "justification": "The dialogue is engaging and fits the tense atmosphere of an interrogation, though some lines could be more nuanced. The emotional stakes are clear, and the characters behave consistently within their roles. The tension is palpable, especially with the choices presented, creating a compelling narrative flow. However, the emotional coherence could be improved by deepening the protagonist's internal conflict.",
