  "brief": "You are a senior intelligence officer summoned to a sealed conference room inside a foreign embassy at night. A junior diplomat has been caught leaking classified negotiation documents during a fragile peace summit. The leak may have been coerced through blackmail involving a hidden personal scandal. The building is under quiet lockdown, and if this situation becomes public it could collapse the treaty talks and trigger military escalation. You must extract the truth while preserving diplomatic stability. The diplomat may be lying, panicking, or protecting someone more powerful."
